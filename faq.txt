Do you have a schedule?
As we get closer to the summer, we'll post a schedule of events here. Stay tuned!

What if I'm not a current intern?
Because space at events is limited, we're only allowing current interns to participate. Sorry!

Who are you?
We're two undergraduates at Princeton University that are hoping to make guacamole all summer.
